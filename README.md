# Number Guessing Game

This is a simple number guessing game implemented in Python. The program generates a random number between a specified range, and the player has to guess the number within a limited number of attempts.

## Requirements

To run this program, you need to have Python installed on your system. The code is compatible with Python 3.

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository to your local machine or download the source code as a ZIP file.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the following command to start the game:

   ```
   python number_guessing_game.py
   ```

4. Follow the instructions on the screen to play the game.

## Features

- The program generates a random number within a specified range.
- The player can input their guess, and the program provides feedback on whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct.
- The player has a limited number of attempts to guess the correct number.
- After each guess, the program displays the number of remaining attempts.
- Once the player guesses the correct number or runs out of attempts, the game ends, and the player is notified of the result.

## Example

Here's an example of how the game looks when running:

```
Welcome to the Number Guessing Game!

I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.
You have 10 attempts to guess the number.

Enter your guess: 50
Too high! Try again.

Enter your guess: 25
Too low! Try again.

Enter your guess: 37
Congratulations! You guessed the number in 3 attempts.

Game over. Thanks for playing!
```
